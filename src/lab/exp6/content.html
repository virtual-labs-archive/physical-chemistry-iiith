<!--Infrared spectroscopy or IR spectroscopy is the technique that involves the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, between the visible and microwave regions and works mostly based on absorption spectroscopy. As with all the spectroscopic techniques, IR spectroscopy is used in the identification and study of molecules and substances. One of the common laboratory instruments that use this technique is a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. 
The infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is usually divided into three regions; the near or higher energy IR (14000–4000 cm−1), mid IR (4000–400 cm−1 ) and far or low energy  infrared (400–10 cm−1). The mid-infrared is used to study the fundamental vibrations and associated rotational-vibrational structure of a molecule or substance.-->
Infrared region lies  between the visible and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum and works mostly based on absorption spectroscopy. The infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is usually divided into three regions; the near or higher energy IR,  mid IR  and far or low energy infrared. The mid-infrared which is (4000 - 400 cm<sup>-1</sup> ) gives the fundamental vibrations and associated rotational-vibrational structure of the substance under study. Infrared spectroscopy is an absorption of infrared radiation by the molecules and is used to elucidate the structure of the molecule by identifying their functional groups.  One of the common laboratory instruments that use this technique is a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer.

When two atoms combine to form a stable covalent moleculer,  there are two repulsion forces acting between the two hetero atoms. One between the  positively charged nuclei of both the  atoms and the other between the negative electron clouds. The other force is the attraction between the nucleus of one atom with the electons of the other atom. Balancing the forces between them, the two atoms settle at a mean internuclear distance or the bond length where the total energy of the system is minimum.    Any change like pulling the atoms away or squeezing them brings change in the bond length which requires an input of energy.<br/><br/>
A diatomic molecule with the above description is considered as two vibrating masses that are connected by a spring. The internuclear distance between the atoms at energy minimum is referred to as the equilibrium distance (r<sub>e</sub>)Any change in this distance is given by Hooke' law as:<br/><br/>

</p><center> f = -k(r-r<sub>e</sub>)</center><p></p><p><br/>

where f  is the restoring force and r is the bond length. The energy associated cinsidering the energy curve to be parobolic is given as :<br/>

</p><center> E= 1/2k(r-r<sub>e</sub>)<sup>2</sup> </center><p></p><p><br/>
</p><center> <img src="./images/figure2_exp6.png" style="width:320px; height:295px;"/> </center><p></p><p>

Figure 2: Vibrational energy levels and allowed transitions between them for a diatomic molecule in a simple harmonic motion.<br/>

For any haormonic oscillator, when the bond vibrates, its enrgy of vibration is changing continually and periodically from kinetic to potential enrgy and back again. The total energy is proportional to the frequency of vibration, and is given as:<br/><br/>
                           </p><center> E<sub>osc</sub> = hν<sub>osc</sub><br/></center><p></p><p>

The elastic nature of the bond has an intrinsic vibrational frequency which is determined by the force constant K of the spring or its stiffness, the masses of the bonded atoms.<br/>

</p><center> <img src="./images/equation1.png" style="width:103px; height:51px;"/> </center><p></p><p>

where c is the speed of light, and μ is the  reduced mass of the system which is given by:<br/><br/>
                           </p><center> μ = m<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub>/m<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub></center><p></p><p><br/>
The value of the force constant varies from bond to bond. K for a triple bond is three times those of a single bond and for a double bond it is twice those of a single bond. There are two significant features that can be drawn:<br/><br/>
1.      Strong bonds have large force constants and vibrate at a higher frequency than the weaker bonds.<br/>
2.      Bonds between the heavy atoms (larger reduced mass) vibrate at a lower frequency than that of bonds between the lighter atoms.<br/>

<b>Sample preparation for Infrared spectroscopy:</b><br/>
The sample to be measured must be taken in a sample holder or cell which is made of ionic substance. Sodium chloride or potassium bromide plates are used. Potassium bromide plates are more expensive than sodium chloride but has an advantage over the sodium chloride because of the asbsorbs at 650cm-1. Glass or platics absorb strongly through the infrared region.<br/><br/>

<b>Liquids:</b> A drop of the liquid sample is placed between a pair of polished IR salt plates. The plates are pressed together  and the sample forms a thin film between the salt plates. A spectrum obtained by this method is neat for there is no use of solvent in the sample preparation.<br/><br/>

<b>Solids:</b> One of the methods used to prepare sample is the Bbr Pellet method. Where the sample is powdered along with KBr and pressed under high pressure to form a pellet.<br/><br/>
The other method is the Nujol method where the sample is ground along with few drops of mineral oil or nujol and the thick suspension is place between the salt plates.<br/>

<b>The Infrared Spectrometer:</b><br/>
The infrared spectrometer or the spectrophotometer is the instrument that determines the IR absorption spectra of a compound. There are two types of spectrometers that are widely used in laboratories.<br/>
a. Dispersive infrared spectrometers<br/>
b. Fourier-Transform spectrometers<br/>

Figure4: The main components of a fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer.<br/>

FT-IR spectrometers are the modern spectometers that provide the spectrum more rapidly than the dispersive ones. The optical pathway produces a  pattern called the interferogram. This is a complex signal which is a plot of intensity versus time. For more practical purposes this time-domine spectrum is converted to a frequency-domain spectrum, that is intensity versus frequency. This conversion is done by a mathematical operation called a Fourier-Transform (FT). FT separates the individual frequencies from the interferogram producing a virtual spectrum identical to the one abtained form dispersive spectrometers.  The biggest advantage of using a FT-IR spectometers is that it is possible to collect number of interferograms of the same sample in less than a second. When a fourier-Transform is performed a sum of all the interferograms gives spectrum which has a better signal to noise ratio. Greater speed and greater sensitivity makes FT-IR spectrometers preferred over dispersive spectometers.


<!--the organic molecules absorb the Infrared radiation and convert them into energy of  molecular vibration. Compounds with different functional groups absorb infrared radiation at different wavelengths. A molecule can vibrate in many ways, and each way is called a vibrational mode. For molecules with N atoms in them, linear molecules have 3N – 5 degrees of vibrational modes, whereas nonlinear molecules have 3N – 6 degrees of vibrational modes (also called vibrational degrees of freedom). As an example H2O, a non-linear molecule, will have 3 × 3 – 6 = 3 degrees of vibrational freedom, or modes. The atoms in a CH2 group, commonly found in organic compounds, can vibrate in six different ways: symmetric and antisymmetric stretching, scissoring, rocking, wagging and twisting. An IR spectrum is a plot of wavenumber (X-axis) vs percent transmittance (Y-axis)<br><br> 
A classical IR spectro meter involves absorption of samples are scanned, whereas  a , Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is an interferometric method. An FTIR spectrometer consist of an infrared source, an interferometer, the sample, and the infrared detector. The interferometer is the heart of the spectrometer and consists in its simplest form of a beam splitter, a fixed mirror, and a moving mirror scanning back and forth. Therefore, the spectrum is not directly measured but its interferogram, i.e. the IR intensity reaching the detector as a function of the mirror position. The spectrum is subsequently obtained by Fourier transformation of the interferogram from the time domain into the frequency domain.<br><br>  
The major advantages of FTIR spectroscopy, as compared to conventional dispersive IR spectroscopy, are the so-called multiplexing advantage (Felgett advantage) and the high energy flux reaching the detector (Jacquinot advantage), allowing rapid spectrum acquisition at a high signal to noise ratio.<br>
