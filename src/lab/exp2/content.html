Free radicals are atoms, molecules or ions with unpaired electrons and are chemically very reactive. Free radicals play important role in  photosynthesis, oxidation, catalysis, and polymerization reactions. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance technique detects the species with unpaired electrons (paramagnetic species) such as free radicals, many transition metal ions and defects in material. EPR spectrum of a free radical or coordination complex with a single unpaired electron is the simplest of all the spectroscopy studies. Free radicals are often short-lived (with few exceptions) and conventional continous wave(cw) EPR spectroscopy which is not time resolved technique represent a challenge. In such cases various techniques like in situ steady state analysis and spin trapping studies become useful.

Electron Paramagnetic Resoance technique is used to identify the paramagnetic species and is very similar to Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. Instead of meauring the nuclear transitions in the case of NMR, EPR is the detection of unpaired electrons in an applied magnetic field. The electron with a magnetic moment of its own behave like a tiny bar magnet. In the presence of external magnetic field, the paramagnetic electrons can either orient in a direction parallel or antiparallel to the direction of the magnetic field creating two distinct energy levels for the unpaired electron which is measured. EPR provides an incontrovertible proof for the presence of free radicals The anisotropy is small in organic radicals so it is necessary to use high frequency/high filed spectrometers to resolve anisotropy.

<a name="c1">3.1.  Working principle:</a> <br> -->
<b>Working principle:</b><br>
For studing the radicals and radical ions specific techniques have to employed because of their unstability in most of the cases. The degeneracy of the spins states (mS = ±1/2) is lifted the external magnetic field from the spectrometer and the transistion between the two levels is caused by the irradiation of the microwave radiation on the sample at a fixed fequency. The unparied electrons can be distinguished from the the free electrons by integration intensity proportional to the concentration of the radicals. An unpaired electron would interact with its environment and the nature of interaction would determine the EPR spectrum of the corresponding sample. <br><br>
In the case of free radicals there are two kinds of environmental interactions which are considered important:<br>
<br>
1)      The extent that the unpaired electron has unquenched orbital angular momentum, the total magnetic moment is different from the spin-only moment (either larger or smaller, depending on how the angular momentum vectors couple). It is customary to lump the orbital and spin angular momenta together in an effective spin and to treat the effect as a shift in the energy of the spin transition. <br>
2)      The electron spin energy levels are split by interaction with nuclear magnetic moments - the nuclear hyperfine interaction. Each nucleus of spin I splits the electron spin levels into (2I + 1) sublevels. Since transitions are observed between sublevels with the same values of mI, nuclear spin splitting of energy levels is mirrored by splitting of the resonance line.
<br><br>
<b>Type of Radicals:</b><br>
Neutral or free radicals: Aromatic ethers and halogenated alkanes or aromatics solvents are frequency used.<br>
Charged radicals: The detection of EPR of these species is efficient and simple if the follow up oxidant or the reductant is EPR inactive. So that ther is no overlap with the desired radical spectrum.<br>
Radical cations: Cationic radical are much less stable. They appear prominently in mass spectrometry.<br>
Radical Anions: They are very sensitive to protic solvents. Solvent should be extremely dry , degassed and stored under vaccum. Preferred choice of solvents are the ethers like dimethoxyethane, tetradydrofuran and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran.<br><br>

<b>The g-factor:</b><br>
The g factor for organic radicals are in general similar to that of a free electron for light atoms. In the case of heavy atoms the spin -orbital coupling leads to shift in the g factor on the order of 10-3 to 10-4. and  is characteristic of types of radicals, depending spin density of the atoms.
<br><br>

<b>Other techniques to study free radicals: </b><br>
The EPR spin-trapping technique: plays a vital role in detection of free radicals in many pathologies and toxicities. Widely used in biomedical field.<br>

EPR spin-labelling: is used to tag a macromolecule in specific region by spin labelling the paramagnetic molecule. Used in understanding the hydrophobicity, pH, fluidity of the environment. Widely uded by  biochemist.<br>

ESEEM and ENDOR: these methods measure the interactions of the electron with the surrounding nuclei. Used in probing the structure of active sites in metalloproteins.<br>

Another applications of  EPR is radiation dosimetry which includes,  dose measurements for sterilization of medical goods and foods, detection of irradiated foods, and the dating of early human artifacts.<br>
<br><br>

<b>Basic components of ERP spectrometer and their functions:</b><br>
In a continoueus wave EPR spectroscopy, the sensitivity and the resolution of the spectrometer determine the resolution of the spectrum. The most important of all is the ability to measure a very low concentration sample and get a high resolution spectrum<br>

1. Microwave generator: Continoues suppy of microwaves at controlle power tuneable over a limited range of frequency. Commonly used frequency is the X-band (9.25 Ghz tuneable range is 8.8 to 9.6 Ghz)<br>

2. Sample cavity: The physical diemension of the cavities differs with the different frequencies. The rectangular X band cavity has a 11 mm diameter and 40 mm lenght sample access. The sample need to be on the vertical and positioned at the center of the cavity where the microwave field is intense.<br>

3. Electromagnet: The electromagnets gernerate the magnetic field that is reproducible and varies lineraly over a range of magnetic field. The magnetic system has hold on two controls. The one that sets the filed and the timing of the field sweep and the other that controls the current in the magnet to set the required magnetic field value.<br>

4. Filed Modulation system: modulation field allows the use of phase sensitive detection.<br>

5. Detection system: meaures the amount of microwave signal reflected from the cavity.  Change in the level of reflected microwave energy at different field strengths gives the spectroscopic transitions.<br>

EPR spin-labelling is a technique used by biochemists whereby a paramagnetic molecule (i.e, the spin label) is used to tag macromolecules in specific regions. From the EPR spectra reported by the spin label, they can determine the type of environment (hydrophobicity, pH, fluidity, etc.) in which the spin label is located.<br><br>
